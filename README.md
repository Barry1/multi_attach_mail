# Multi Attach Mail

Sometimes you have to send many big attachments via Email but all together are too big for one.
This is the solution - just place the files in one folder, configure your SMTP credentials and specify the recipients.

## Description

Just a small python utility which helps you to send multiple attachments in as many emails as files.
